# Headlights

Headlights is a tool for staying focused. It's a pomodoro timer with a strict taskmaster component: it asks you what you want to do next and how long it will take, and fills your computer screen until you answer. Once you've answered, a timer overlay helps you rememeber what you're working on. Once the timer completes, it asks again, and the cycle repeats.

## Shortcuts

`Ctrl+Alt+Q` (`Cmd+Option+Q` on Mac): quit app.
