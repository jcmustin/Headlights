  "description": "Headlights is a tool for staying focused. It's a pomodoro timer with a strict taskmaster component: it asks you what you want to do next and how long it will take, and fills your computer screen until you answer. Once you've decided on a task, a timer overlay helps you rememeber what you're working on. Once the timer completes, it asks again, and the cycle repeats.",
